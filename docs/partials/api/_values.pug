    | <kbd>$v</kbd> model represents the current state of validation.
    | It does so by defining a set of properties which hold the output
    | of user defined validation functions, following the <kbd>validations</kbd>
    | option structure.
    | The presense of those special reserved keywords means that you cannot specify
    | your own validators with that name.

            | A flag representing if the field under validation was touched by the user at least once.
            | Usually it is used to decide if the message is supposed to be displayed to the end user.
            | Flag is managed manually. You have to use <kbd>$touch</kbd> and <kbd>$reset</kbd> methods
            | to manipulate it. The <kbd>$dirty</kbd> flag is considered <kbd>true</kbd> if given model was
            | <kbd>$touch</kbd>ed or <strong>all of it's children</strong> are <kbd>$dirty</kbd>.

            | Holds all validation models of collection validator. Always preserves

            | loop iterating over your data using the same index.
